Thomn is an Android application that allows users to read and navigate the Holy Quran on their mobile devices. The app features two main functions: Index and Goto.

[![Get it on Google Play](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png)]()


## Features

### Index feature

The Index feature allows users to quickly jump from one surah to another. The surahs are listed in the order they appear in the Quran, making it easy to find and select the desired surah.

### Goto Feature

The Goto feature allows users to find a specific 'hizb' or 'thomn' within the Quran. Simply select the desired 'hizb' or 'thomn' from the dropdown, and the app will take you directly to the corresponding page.

## Mushaf of the application

The used mushaf in this application is the **Chadli** mushaf of algeria.

This mushaf is divided into 60 **'hizb's** and every 'hizb' is divided into 8 **'thomn's** to help its users to memorize it.
